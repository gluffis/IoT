This is my Arduino compatible code used on my WeMos board for measuring temperature and humidity at regular intervals. Using DHT11 sensor and a powershield for battery feeding. 

Code could/should probably be optimized more, getting rid of serial output since noone reads that.

Also WiFi setup could probably be optimized , have not really dug into that yet.

I have added my ugly PHP hack for reporting also in the Web directory
